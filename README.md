## AR Postcard
Hey, many of us are from an era where we used to send postcards to our friends, I mean many of us still do, but that was the mainstream way of showing affection back then. We'd decorate postcards, customize them, put on a stamp that would validate it according to the local laws and then it'll be sent to practically anyone you would want to. We were rooting for that experience in this modern world. And AR/VR are definitely the technologies of the modern time. So we were like won't it be great to make a fusion of both, and come up with something that'll serve as postcards, but with all the information showing through an AR way, to make it spicy and exciting. That is how we came up with our idea AR postcards, straightforward and filled with fun!!

## What it does 
AR postcards serves as a platform of its own, a social media platform where users can send and scan postcards from their dearest friends. A user can create a personalised postcard, where they can upload the assets (4 images, 1 video and a smol note) as the main content, and then they get to design and cutomise it using AR. They can choose the color, texture, font color of their card, and put on a small message to be displayed over the card, just like normal conventional cards. After this setup it done, the users can get their cards by downloading them, which they can personally print or just send to whosoever they want. Also, once can't really send videos over postcard right? We've made that possible as well.

## Running it locally

Due to browser restrictions surrounding use of the camera, you must use HTTPS to access the HTML files, even if doing so locally from your computer. You can use the [ZapWorks command-line tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zappar/zapworks-cli) to serve a folder over HTTPS for access on your local computer, like this:
```
zapworks serve .
```

The command also lets you serve the folder for access by other devices on your local network, like this:
```
zapworks serve . --lan
```

Once this is running, open the link that's output on the console and tap the different HTML files to try the examples. If you'd like to try on a mobile device, ensure it's on the same local network as your computer, then visit the appropriate link in the console output.
